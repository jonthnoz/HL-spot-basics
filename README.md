# HL-spot-basics

This Python script implements a cryptocurrency trading bot that operates on the Hyperliquid exchange. It's designed for spot trading of a specified cryptocurrency (e.g., HFUN) against USDC. The bot automatically opens long positions, sets take-profit orders, implements a stop-loss strategy, and closes positions based on market conditions.

Consider this as a tutorial for getting started with Hyperliquid trading bots. You can use this code as a base to build more complex trading strategies or customize it to suit your needs.

If you don't have a Hyperliquid account yet, you can sign up [here](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/join/L1GHT), using the referral code "L1GHT" to support this project and get a discount on trading fees.

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes only. Use it at your own risk. The author is not responsible for any financial losses incurred while using this bot. Always do your own research before trading cryptocurrencies.

## Main Features:

-   Monitors cryptocurrency price on Hyperliquid exchange
-   Opens long positions based on account balance and random chance
-   Sets take-profit orders at 4% above entry price
-   Implements a stop-loss at 4% below entry price
-   Closes positions if stop-loss is triggered
-   Sends trade notifications via Telegram (optional but recommended for monitoring)

## How It Works:

-   The bot runs in a continuous loop, checking market conditions and account balances
-   Uses [Hyperliquid Python SDK](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk) for exchange interactions and trade execution
-   Take-profit is set as a limit order on the exchange
-   Stop-loss is managed by the bot's code (not supported directly by Hyperliquid for spot trading)
-   Persists stop-loss information in a file for resilience against restarts

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Python on your computer if you haven't already.

2. Clone this repository (if you have Git installed):

```
git clone https://github.com/jonthnoz/HL-spot-basics
```

Or download and extract the ZIP file if you don't have Git (click on the green Code button above, or [here](https://github.com/jonthnoz/HL-spot-basics/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)).

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd HL-spot-basics
```

5. Install required libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Configure the bot:

Copy config.example.json to config.json  
Edit config.json with your personal details (see Configuration section)

6. Run the bot:

```
python main.py
```

## Configuration

Edit config.json with your personal details:

```jsonCopy
{
    "secret_key": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
    "address": "YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS",
    "bot_token": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN",
    "chat_id": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID",
    "spot_coin": "HFUN",
    "spot_amount": 50
}
```

-   secret_key: Your wallet private key
    (For more security, consider using a hyperliquid API wallet or agent. Create a new one from [the IU](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/API) or see the [Python example](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/basic_agent.py))
-   address: Your Ethereum public address
-   bot_token: Telegram bot token for notifications
-   chat_id: Telegram chat ID for receiving notifications
-   spot_coin: Cryptocurrency to trade (e.g., "HFUN")
-   spot_amount: Amount in USDC to trade with

## Setting Up Telegram Notifications (Optional but Recommended)

1. Create a Telegram Bot:

-   Start a chat with BotFather on Telegram
-   Send /newbot and follow the prompts
-   Save the API token provided by BotFather

2. Get Your Chat ID:

-   Start your newly created bot with the Telegram account you want to receive messages on
-   Use @userinfobot:
    -   Start a chat with @userinfobot
    -   It will reply with your chat ID

3. Update config.json with the bot token and chat ID

## FAQ

**Q: Is this bot suitable for beginners?**
A: This bot is designed for educational purposes and will most likely be unprofitable as it executes random trades. Beginners can use it to learn about trading bots and customize the code to experiment with different strategies.

While it is designed to be user-friendly, it's recommended that users have a basic understanding of cryptocurrency trading and programming. Always start with small amounts and carefully monitor the bot's performance.

**Q: Can I run this bot 24/7?**
A: Yes, you can run this bot continuously. However, you'll need to ensure that your computer or server remains on and connected to the internet. Consider using a cloud service for uninterrupted operation.

**Q: How do I customize the trading strategy?**
A: You can modify the `main.py` file to adjust the trading logic. For example, you can change the take-profit and stop-loss percentages, or add additional conditions for opening trades.

**Q: Is it safe to use my private key in the configuration?**
A: While the script is designed to keep your private key local, it's generally not recommended to use your main wallet's private key. Consider creating a separate wallet for trading or using Hyperliquid's API wallet feature for enhanced security.

If you consider using cloud services, make sure to keep your private key secure, which may involve removing it from the config file and using environment variables or secure storage.

**Q: How can I track the bot's performance?**
A: The bot sends notifications via Telegram for each trade. For more detailed tracking, consider adding logging functionality to the script or integrating with a trading journal tool.

**Q: Can this bot be used on other exchanges?**
A: This bot is specifically designed for Hyperliquid. Adapting it to other exchanges would require significant modifications to the code and is not recommended for beginners.
